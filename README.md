> üîî We are improving the richness and reliability of this repository. Please submit an issue (or a pull request) if you find (or solve) any bugs/problems.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository serves as an early exploration for academics purpose. We do not provide production-level quality assurance.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üï∂Ô∏è Implementation Overview

As shown in the figure below, 

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/controlplane.svg" width=90% />
</div>


### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

This repository has strict hardware and software requirements.

** Hardware Requirements **

* Tofino-based Hardware Switch (e.g., Wdege-100BF-XX)
* At least one Server with QSFP28 connectors and wires.

** Software Requirements **

* Switch OS: 4.14.151-OpenNetworkLinux
* Python 3.8.10 
* SDE Version 9.7.0+ (the same is best)
* Cmake Version 3.6+

> üîî In this document, all 'python' and 'pip' refer to the python version of 3.8.10.

There are some dependencies for control plane functions. To install them.
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/NASA-NJU/FlyMon.git"
cd FlyMon
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### üî® Build Data Plane



<details><summary><b>Build a Customized FlyMon Dataplane</b></summary>

```bash
python flymon_compiler.py -n 9 -m memory_level_min
```

The above command means that 9 CMU-Groups are generated in the data plane, and each CMU has a static (maximum) memory type of 'memory_level_mini'.  

> Here we generate 'mini'-size CMUs (i.e., only 32 16-bit counters in each CMU) for easy viewing of memory status. You can choose a larger level of memory (e.g., memory_level_8) for more practical purposes. The configurable memory levels are visible in `flymon_compiler.py`.



The above command will generate two types of files. 
* P4-based data plane codes located in [p4src](p4src/). 
* Json-based Data plane configurations in [control_plane](control_plane/cmu_groups.json) used to help initialize the control plane interfaces.

Then, you can build the p4 codes with bf-p4c. Here we give a setup script if you don't known how to compile the codes.


```bash
# If we are working on SDE 9.7.0
./setup.sh
```

<details><summary><b>Run FlyMon System and Install Tasks</b></summary>

```bash
# Load the P4 program
$SDE/run_switchd.sh -p <FlyMon>

# Login to FlyMon console
python control_plane/main_loop.py

### Deep Use Cases

TODO


## Simulation

### Single CMU-Group Implementation

The main branch is a reference implementation of single CMU-Group, which includes:
* P4-16 codes of the CMU-Group. We implement an additional task registration module and heavy key reporting module.
* A demo control plane which shows how to:
    * dynamically install measurement tasks.
    * dynamically allocate memory with different size.
    * collect deduplicated heavy keys and output to std-out.
    * configure the dynamic hash unit to generate an arbitrary compressed key in the compression stage (temporarily removed, see NOTE2 below). 

### Cross-stacking 9 CMU-Groups

To see the cross-stacking version of FlyMon, please checkout to the `stackable_cmug` branch.

### Strawman Implementation of CMU

To see the strawman solution (without optimizations on key-selection and attribute-operation), please checkout to the `strawman_solution` branch.

**NOTE#1** : for historical reasons, the compression unit (CU) is referred to as the shared compression stage. The execution unit (EU) is referred to as composable measurement unit (CMU). The transformable measurement unit (TMU) is referred to CMU-Group. We are working on refactoring the code to the correct component name.

**NOTE#2** : since INTEL [Open-Tofino](https://github.com/barefootnetworks/Open-Tofino/tree/master/p4-examples/p4_16_programs/tna_dyn_hashing) has not open-sourced the relevant code of the dynamic hash masking, we temporarily removed this part of the control plane code. Please update SDE to 9.7.0+ and get the sample code.
We  also remove `headers.p4` and `utils.p4`, which can be obtained at [Open-Tofino](https://github.com/barefootnetworks/Open-Tofino/tree/master/p4-examples/p4_16_programs/tna_dyn_hashing).

## Simulation

For the convenience of experimentation, we implemented a simulated version of FlyMon in C++ to test algorithms accuracy. Note that the simulation is not a simple implementation of the algorithms with c++. It also uses match-action tables to construct the measurement algorithms, just like the hardware implementation.
In addition, we constructed an automated testing framework to repeat the experiment. The simulation code is located in the [simulations](./simulations) directory.
