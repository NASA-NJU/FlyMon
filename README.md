## üöÑ Hardware Implementation

### üï∂Ô∏è Overview

As shown in the figure below, the FlyMon hardware implementation is based on the Tofino hardware platform, including the SDE, runtime interfaces, etc.

</div>

To better test and use FlyMon, we did some engineering efforts for the implementation of the data plane and the control plane.

For the data plane, our P4 codes are generated by using the [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) template (we need to thank the author of [BeauCoup](https://github.com/Princeton-Cabernet/BeauCoup) that inspired us to do so). The Jinja2 templates (located in [p4_templates](./p4_templates/)) allow us to flexibly and quickly extend our data plane codes to avoid various bugs. For example, when deploying 9 CMU-Groups, the P4 codes reache over 5000 LOC, which is difficult to maintain manually. More importantly, we can easily modify the configuration of the data plane, such as the number of CMU-Groups, the set of candidate keys, the size of the static memory of a single CMU, etc.

For the control plane, we provide user-friendly, interactive interfaces to dynamically configure tasks (i.e., add and delete tasks). We performe layers of abstraction, gradually shielding the underlying hardware details. When compiling the data plane code, the [FlyMon compiler](./flymon_compiler.py) also generates [a configuration file](./control_plane/cmu_groups.json) for the control plane, which is used to adjust the control plane's interfaces to adapt to various underlayer data plane configurations.

Below we show how to use these codes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

This repository has strict hardware and software requirements.

**Hardware Requirements**

* Tofino-based Hardware Switch (e.g., Wdege-100BF-XX).
* At least one Server with QSFP28 connectors and wires.

**Software Requirements**

* Switch OS: OpenNetworkLinux 4.14.151
* Python: 3.8.10 
* SDE: Version 9.7.0+ (the same is best)

> üîî In this document, all 'python' and 'pip' refer to the python version of 3.8.10.

There are some dependencies for control plane functions. To install them.
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/NASA-NJU/FlyMon.git"
cd FlyMon
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### üî® Build Data Plane

In order to generate your custom data plane code, use the Jinja2 code generator we provide.

```bash
python flymon_compiler.py -n 2 -m memory_level_min
```

The above command will generate 2 CMU-Groups in the data plane, and each CMU has a static (maximum) memory type of 'memory_level_mini' (32 counters in each register).  

> üîî For easy viewing of memory status, we generate mini-level CMUs (i.e., only 32 16-bit counters in each CMU) here. You can choose a larger level of memory (e.g., memory_level_8) for more practical purposes. The available memory levels are list in `flymon_compiler.py`.

Once the data plane codes are generated, you can build the p4 codes with bf-p4c. Here we give a setup script if you don't known how to compile the codes.

```bash
# If you are working on SDE 9.7.0+
export FLYMON_DIR=/path/to/your/flymon
./setup.sh
```
> üîî You also need to check if SDE environment variables (e.g., `SDE` and `SDE_INSTALL`) are set correctly.

> üîî The compilation process usually takes between 20 and 60 minutes. Yes, it does compile slowly, but please be patient. 


### üöÄ Running FlyMon

Lauching FlyMon requires starting the data plane and the control plane separately.

Firstly, load the program for the data plane.

```bash
$SDE/run_switchd.sh -p flymon
```

Secondly, start the FlyMon interactive control plane in another terminal.
```
cd $FLYMON_DIR/control_plane/
./run_controller.sh
```

If all goes well, you will be taken to the command line interface of FlyMon.

 Add a task to CMU-Group.
        Args:
            "-f", "--filter" required=True, e.g., SrcIP=10.0.0.*,DstIP=*.*.*.*
            "-k", "--key" required=True, e.g., hdr.ipv4.src_addr/24,hdr.ipv4.dst_addr
            "-a", "--attribute" type=[frequency, distinct, max, existence], required=True,
            "-m", "--mem_size" type=int, required=True
            **A Complete Example** : 
                add_task -f 10.0.0.0/8,* -k hdr.ipv4.src_addr/24 -a frequency(1) -m 48
                        This will allocate the task, which monitors on packet with SrcIP=10.0.0.*, 
                        and count for key=SrcIP/24, attribute=PacketCount, memory with 48 counters (3x16 count-min sketch)
        Returns:
            Added task id or -1.
        Exceptions:
            parser error of the key, the attribute, the memory. 
```
</details>

Currently, we implement the functions of task deployment, deletion, status show, data reading, etc. We also implement other features, such as simple configuration of ports and install forwarding rules. But these functions can also be completed from the original SDE interfaces.

### üìù Use Cases

We demonstrate the dynamic features of FlyMon through three typical use cases.

<details><summary><b>Frequency Estimation</b></summary>

Suppose we deploy a new measurement task. We define key as SrcIP/24 and attribute as frequency(1). We are interested in the traffic with SrcIP in 10.0.0.0/8. We can deploy this measurement task with the `add_task` command.

```
flymon> add_task -f 10.0.0.0/8,* -k hdr.ipv4.src_addr/24 -a frequency(1) -m 48
```

The above command will deploy a Count-Min Sketch (d=3, w=16) in the data plane for this task.

If there are enough resources in the data plane to deploy this measurement task, you will get the following output.

```
flymon> add_task -f 10.0.0.0/8,* -k hdr.ipv4.src_addr/24 -a frequency(1) -m 48
Required resources:
[ResourceType: CompressedKey, Content: hdr.ipv4.src_addr/24]
[ResourceType: CompressedKey, Content: hdr.ipv4.src_addr/24]
[ResourceType: CompressedKey, Content: hdr.ipv4.src_addr/24]
[ResourceType: Memory, Content: 16]
[ResourceType: Memory, Content: 16]
[ResourceType: Memory, Content: 16]
----------------------------------------------------
[Active Task] 
Filter= [('10.0.0.0', '255.0.0.0'), ('0.0.0.0', '0.0.0.0')]
ID = 1
Key = hdr.ipv4.src_addr/24
Attribute = frequency(1)
Memory = 48(3*16)
Locations:
 - loc0 = group_id=1, group_type=1, hkeys=[1], cmu_id=1, memory=((2, 0))
 - loc1 = group_id=1, group_type=1, hkeys=[2], cmu_id=2, memory=((2, 0))
 - loc2 = group_id=1, group_type=1, hkeys=[3], cmu_id=3, memory=((2, 0))

[Success] Allocate TaskID: 1 
```
</details>



<details><summary><b>Dynamic Memory Allocation</b></summary>


</details>


<details><summary><b>Single-key Distinct Counting (Flow Cardinality)</b></summary>


</details>


<details><summary><b>Multi-key Distinct Counting</b></summary>


</details>


<details><summary><b>Capture Maximum Packet Size</b></summary>


</details>


The flexibility of FlyMon lies in the ability to arbitrarily adjust the flow key, flow attribute, and memory size for the above tasks. The tasks that FlyMon can perform are not limited to the above use cases. We will add more use cases in the future.


## üìè Simulation Framework

For the convenience of experimentation, we implemented a simulated version of FlyMon in C++ to test algorithms accuracy. Note that the simulation is not a simple implementation of the algorithms with c++. It also uses match-action tables to construct the measurement algorithms, just like the hardware implementation.
In addition, we constructed an automated testing framework to repeat the experiment. The simulation code is located in the [simulations](./simulations) directory.
